<p>I stopped blogging ages ago, so this is the best way I could think of to log form this.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday, I went to the eye doctor because of messed up vision in my left eye. They told me I had a detatched retina and needed emergency surgery. I ran over to the surgeon and they began to examine me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They told me it&#8217;s not a detached retina, but an ocular melanoma.  You can read up on the details here: <a href="http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/disease.htm" class="bare">http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/disease.htm</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically I have a tumor at the back of my eye. Fluid is leaking into the eye which is causing the vision problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t know how long it has been there, but it wasn&#8217;t found at my eye exam in July of 2016.  Tomorrow I go in to determine if the bastard has spread beyond my eye and determine a course of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m a bit on edge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I&#8217;m determined to kick the living hell out of this thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just the easiest way to let everyone on here know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
