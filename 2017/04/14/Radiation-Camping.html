<p>Hello all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been a little over 24 hours since I checked into a hotel in Philadelphia after my first surgery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Sunday, I flew out to Philadelpha. My parents picked me up and I slept in the bed of my youth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Monday morning, I was at Wills Eye Center at 7am. I was trying to register, but the staff didn&#8217;t know I was supposed to be there. I guess that&#8217;s what happens when the doctors running the place make promises over the weekend. Remember this when your upper management makes a promise that you don&#8217;t know about. The staff was awesome trying to help me out. They didn&#8217;t publically bitch to me about how the docs didn&#8217;t communicate well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took a good hour to get Ohio State to send over all of the scans and pictures over to Wills. Some of them were useful, some were not. Wills basically did the same pictures and scans with different equipment over a 10 hour stay. Yes 10 hours. No joke.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We left Wills with a plan for surgery on Thursday and a need of getting blood work done and a physical. That&#8217;s sort of tough since I&#8217;m not in Ohio. Fortunately, I was able to get these tasks done on Tuesday with the help of Wills staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, my wife was driving from Columbus to Philadelphia on Tuesday. She couldn&#8217;t have had worse luck. it took her 11 hours because of rain in Columbus not getting her to Zanesville until 9:15. A good hour delay. Accidents on the turnpike in Philly also killed a good hour of time. She got to the house at 6pm with the kids and dog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing that was very smart was finding a way to bring the dog. He&#8217;s 11 months old, and although it was a long miserable anxious trip for him, he&#8217;s enjoying the larger yard at Grandma&#8217;s house and the kids are enjoying spending time with him. I also enjoyed walking him with my wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wednesday, we relaxed as best we could, since Lori and I were getting up at 5 to drive into Philly and check in for surgery by 7 am. Before I knew it, I was meeting with the docs, and wheeling into surgery. I dont even remember counting backwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then drove over to the hotel, got checked in, and sorted out. She grabbed my meds from CVS and spent the night here, which was nice, even though she had to stay far away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The docs from Wills stopped by at 4 to see how I was doing and answer questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, I&#8217;m treating this like a campout. This thing gets taken out early on Monday morning, and then the plan is to drive home early Tuesday morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be well!</p>
