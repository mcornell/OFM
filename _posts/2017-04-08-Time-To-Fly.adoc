My, how things can change in 48 hours.

Yesterday, Friday 4/7, I spent about 6 hours at Ohio State's Havener Eye Institute (http://eye.osu.edu/). I got some awesome scans and pictures of my eye done. I also found out the bastard was quite a bit larger than I thought. Also, much like the scene in Predator, it was one ugly SOB.

I met some awesome doctors who, unwillingly, made me feel like I had accomplished little in my career. My doc is just 2 years older than me (hooray public records) and she is one of 4, people in the Ohio who know what they are doing with this sort of cancer.

And all I've done is write software. Yes, I've writted software to help people manage their finances and help customers, but not to save lives. But I digress.

They came up with a plan, which was similar to what was outlined before. They would order a radioactive plaque. What's interesting is how it's placed on the eye. It will be placed attached to the outside of the eye, where the tumor is. So basically it won't be visible to anyone, because it's effectively by the eye socket. This link explains this quite well (https://eyecancer.com/eye-cancer/treatments/eye-and-vision-sparing-radiation-therapy-for-intraocular-tumors/)

So at OSU, they said, surgery to put this thing in on Thursday, take it out on Monday. Should be back to work two weeks later. Wow! Except, they couldn't start surgery until mid-May due to doctor schedule and the amount of time to get the plaque. I asked if there was any way to move faster.

So the docs at OSU sent a note to Wills Eye Center in Philly (https://www.willseye.org/ocular-oncology-service). Wills is a good choice for me because of family across the river in NJ. It also happens to be "the" place to get this procedure done.

Today I got a phone call around 5pm. I've been accepted into Wills. Show up at 8am on Monday. I used what little frequent flyer miles i have to get a one way ticket to Philly. My wife and kids will drive out on Tuesday.

This adventure keeps getting crazier. But I said before, I'm going to kick this bastard's ass. I really appreciate all of the support and well wishes.

I will continue to update as I have time. Thanks again.
