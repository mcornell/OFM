I stopped blogging ages ago, so this is the best way I could think of to log form this.

Yesterday, I went to the eye doctor because of messed up vision in my left eye. They told me I had a detatched retina and needed emergency surgery. I ran over to the surgeon and they began to examine me.

They told me it's not a detached retina, but an ocular melanoma.  You can read up on the details here: http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/disease.htm

Basically I have a tumor at the back of my eye. Fluid is leaking into the eye which is causing the vision problem.

I don't know how long it has been there, but it wasn't found at my eye exam in July of 2016.  Tomorrow I go in to determine if the bastard has spread beyond my eye and determine a course of action.

Needless to say, I'm a bit on edge.

However, I'm determined to kick the living hell out of this thing.

This is just the easiest way to let everyone on here know.

Thanks for listening.
